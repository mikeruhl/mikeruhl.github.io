Sometimes I think, “it’s just my site, who cares,” but I lost a few good hours of explaining something really cool.</p>\n<p>To be fair, this is the first time it’s happened for real. In prior iterations, I’ve backed up my database and restored it. This time I figured since the database was persisted on the filesystem, it would just start back up ok. Upon closer inspection, it appears my ghost installation, at some point, reverted to a vanilla install and started using the sqlite local database again. I’m not exactly sure how, but it started back up from scratch, so that .db file was brand new when I finally inspected it. Half my posts were in that while half were in a mariadb database. I have the mariadb posts. I don’t have the sqlite posts. Those, I suspect, are gone. So, backup and backup some more. Thinking “well, my data is persisted” didn’t cut it. An updated image started up and cut that theory down pretty quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>The good news!</strong> Yes, there’s good news! I have updated containers running. I <em>sincerely hope</em> I’ve learned my lesson and will read release notes before <code class=\"language-text\">docker pull</code>ing any new containers. I’ll re-post my configuration with updated settings. It’s worth reviewing. A few things changed since updating. For the record, I’ve updated all containers along with the docker engine. So pretty neat. And I’ve added a few perks. This new version of Ghost is pretty snazzy so I don’t regret much.</p>\n<p>I might have to invest in a dev environment, even for this dinky site. Making changes directly in production is never a good idea without testing it first. Docker makes it easy, too. I should post a set up of that. More to come…</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to blog v2!","date":"October 08, 2017","description":"import from previous blog."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/welcome-to-blog-v2/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/comment-policy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Community Guidelines"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
