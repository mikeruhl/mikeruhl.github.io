It will eventually move to a full-featured site offering development services through the name frenetik.io. While that is being developed, a dev blog will take center stage on the domain. I am a self-taught developer who has relied heavily on the community to teach me. This includes co-workers, coding forums, tutorial sites like pluralsight, and good old fashioned books. I absolutely love it and want to help others too. You can find me on codenewbies slack, Stack Overflow, and CodeFights. You can ask questions directly in any channel I’ve provided.</p>\n<p>Frenetik.io is a small company that does desktop, mobile, and web development. At the moment, it is income-less but has infrastructure. If you’re looking to host a website, contact me. We can work out the details. I have about 10 years of devops and development experience. My day job is working for a Fortune 500 company as an Application Lead for internal software that involves full-stack development.</p>\n<h1>Commenting Policy</h1>\n<p>Frenetik.io has the capacity and right to delete any comment it deems unnecessary to social or intellectual progress. This is a development blog, comments should be crafted to offer help to other developers or to ask for help.</p>\n<h3>Hate Speech</h3>\n<p>IAny hate speech will not be tolerated and all steps to ban the user will be taken. This is everyone’s warning. Hate speech includes slurs, suggesting violence towards a group, suggesting another group is worth less than another group, and suggesting your group is better than other groups. This list is not inclusive. Bottom line: don’t be a dick. I’m not a Berkley student banning free speech but I’m also not someone to provide a platform for bigotry.</p>\n<h3>Bounty Program</h3>\n<p>You get Karma for alerting admins of hate speech or other banned content.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Community Guidelines","date":"October 09, 2017","description":"import from previous blog."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/comment-policy/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/welcome-to-blog-v2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to blog v2!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog-theme/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blog Theme Update"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
